CapStone project for City University of Seattle - By Sreelekha Sangitha

Current solutions of chatbots add extra overhead
for customers to take additional time to look up
the website of the product or organization and
use a browser on a mobile or desktop to take
the help of a chatbot. This project aims at
evolving the chatbot solution into the next step
of integrating with one of the voice assistants
using Alexa skills. This will help customers get
answers on any product or business just by
invoking a voice assistant and start asking
questions just like stating a conversation to an
agent.
